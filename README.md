# Hive Airport Vulnerable Web Application

Welcome to the Hive Airport vulnerable web application! This intentionally insecure PHP app is designed for security enthusiasts, developers, and penetration testers to explore and learn about common web vulnerabilities in a realistic airport management context.

## What’s Inside?

- **Employees and Flights Database:** Simulated with real-world-like data to manage airport staff and flight schedules.
- **Vulnerabilities Galore:** From Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Authentication Bypass, NoSQL Injection, and more — this app is a playground for discovering and exploiting security flaws.
- **Hidden Directories & Secrets:** Find the admin panel tucked away, exposed backup files, and hardcoded credentials waiting to be uncovered.
- **Outdated Libraries:** Old versions of jQuery and other scripts to test your skills against known exploits.
- **Insecure Defaults:** Weak configurations and test credentials to challenge your security auditing abilities.

## Features Overview

### Customer Portal
- **Flight Booking:** Search and book flights with ease.
- **Feedback System:** Share your experience or report issues.
- **Profile Management:** Update personal details and view booking history.
- **Store:** Purchase travel-related items and souvenirs.

### Staff Portal

## Why Use Hive Airport?

- **Learn by Doing:** Hands-on experience with real vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
- **Test Your Tools:** Perfect for practicing with Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and other security testing tools.
- **Understand Impact:** See how vulnerabilities can affect a complex system like an airport management app.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup the Environment:**
   - Run `setup.sh` to install dependencies, create the database, and import all necessary data.
   - Start the PHP built-in server with:  
     `php -S 127.0.0.1:9000`

2. **Explore the App:**
   - Visit `http://127.0.0.1:9000` in your browser.
   - Try logging in, submitting feedback, and poking around the admin area.

3. **Try to Break It:**
   - Exploit the XSS on the main portal.
   - Bypass authentication and escalate privileges.
   - Intercept and manipulate traffic with your favorite proxy tools.

## Important Notes

- **Do NOT use this app in production.** It is intentionally vulnerable and unsafe for real-world use.
- **Use responsibly.** This app is for educational purposes only.
